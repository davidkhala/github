## `$ gh` -- Github CLI
- [official: Installing gh on Linux and BSD](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
- [gh vs hub](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/312)
    - For many years, `hub` was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project for us to explore what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to git and `gh` is a standalone tool.
