# Copilot Space

narrowing the context

- attach files, issues and instructions to guide the model
  - Linked files reflect the repository's default branch, and attached issues and pull requests evolve as they change
  - Avoid copying content into separate documents
- > Spaces work best with specific files added.
  - not the alternative of GitHub Project
  - more like a knowledge base
- cannot be public visible
  - either under your personal ownership or visible to your organization.

> Spaces are now available through the GitHub MCP in VSCode.
